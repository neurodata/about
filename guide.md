## Guide to Potential Teammates

### How to Choose a University to Do your PhD

the goal of PhD program is to train you to be able to reach your maximum potential. therefore, when looking for a PhD program, choose one that you believe will do that :) . more concretely, ideally there are multiple groups at the university with whom  you would be interested in pursuing a PhD.  five to six years is a long time and many things can change, so you want your choice to be robust to variability in your preferences and personnel at an institution.



### How to Choose a Group at that University

the two most important factors to consider when choosing a group are: (1) the mentorship you will receive, and (2) your colleagues.  

##### mentorship

each group has a unique style of mentorship, make sure the group you choose has a mentorship style that is good for you.  do you want a hands-on mentor that will speak with you every day? if so, choose a small group.  do you want a more senior mentor that will only check in on you every few weeks or months? if so, choose a larger group.  recall that one of the main benefits you get from a phd is mentorship, so whatever style you choose, make sure it is good for you.  it is a good idea to ask the current trainees of a group about the mentoring, including perhaps some of the following questions:
- how often do you speak with your mentor?
- does she typically provide you with helpful guidance?
- do you feel free to express and explore your own creative ideas when you have them?
- when you are communicating with your mentor, does she recall previous conversations and focus on this one?
- is she available when you "need" her?
- if you give her a manuscript, how long does it take her to provide you with feedback?
- how many trainees are in the group?
- how happy are you while you are working?


##### colleagues

the people in your chosen lab will be sitting around you for the next several years, so you really want to like them, benefit from them, and contribute to them.  so, make sure when visiting that you spend as much time with these people as possible. also, you want them to be interested in questions that overlap with your interests, and have expertise that you will be able to benefit from.  most importantly, you want to at least be friendly with them, because you really will be spending a lot of time with them.  


### How to Choose a Project within that Group

i recommend choosing a project that is in the intersection of things that you are most excited about and the group you are in is most excited about. many faculty have webpages that list all the projects they are currently working on (for example, our [project page](projects.md). thus, you can detet rmine the kinds of projects that will fly in the group.  to determine what you are "most excited about", i recommend  taking the following steps (based on [The Power of Full Engagement](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FC0SWS/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1):
1. Try to determine your "[zone of genius](https://www.actualized.org/blueprint/zone-of-genius)"
2. Determine a project in alignment with your zone of genius and the group's projects
